## Background
This is a project undertaken to assist the ME/FM Society of BC (https://www.mefm.bc.ca/). It provides a public forum for patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) and/or Fibromyalgia (FM) to share information. The current version is a non localized English application for use in Canadian provinces.

Future work on the project is anticipated to include:
- language localization
- geographic localization (i.e. country/(state/province etc.)/city selection lists)
